          </div>
  
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Stucco is a construction material made from a mixture of water, aggregates, and a binder. It's applied wet and hardens into a dense solid. Stucco is applied to the exterior of buildings. It's texture can vary from smooth to highly textured.</p>

            <p>Why use stucco over other materials?</p>
  
            <i class="arrow"></i>
          </div>
  
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Stucco is very durable. It's resistent to fire, rot, mold, impact, and termite infestation. Because of it's durability, stucco is also very sustainable, lasting as long as 100 years or more. In addition, stucco also boasts great appearance and offers unlimited customization as the finish can be anything from smooth to highly textured.</p>

            <p>Why cure stucco?</p>
  
            <i class="arrow"></i>
          </div>
  
          <div class="answer">
            <p>In order for stucco to achieve its optimal strength and durability and therefore go from a work-in-progress to a solid, finished surface, it needs to cure.  As stucco cures, its pH level falls and the surface can accept a finish coating. If the finish coating is applied to the stucco before its done curing, the finish coating can lose adhesion.</p>
