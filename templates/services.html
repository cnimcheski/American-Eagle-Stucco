          <p class="details">If you wish to add an aesthetic look to your exterior, stone or brick veneer is the way to go. Typically, brick gives a more clean look while stone adds a more natural appeal. Not only are stone and brick veneer added for decorative purposes, but both materials also add weather, fire, and water resistance to your establishment.</p>
          <p class="details">At American Eagle Stucco, we understand that each project is different, which is why we highly prioritize customization. Both stone and brick veneer are highly customizable by color, style, thickness, and quantitiy. At the end of the day, our goal is to let you make the choice, and we'll take over the rest.</p>
